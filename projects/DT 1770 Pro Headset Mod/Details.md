### Background
The [Beyerdynamic 'Custom Headset Gear'](https://europe.beyerdynamic.com/custom-headset-gear-2-generation.html) kit turns a limited selection of 3.5mm-equipped headphones into headsets. So far the only headphones I've seen compatible with this are the Philips Fidelo X2 (fantastic headphones) and a few lower-end Beyer models.

My DT 1770 Pro headphones have the port in the right place, but it's a 3-pin XLR socket. However since these sockets are fairly standard panel-fit items, replacing it with a 3.5mm socket should be pretty easy...

### Implementation
Taking apart the left-side 1770 ear cup if simple; if not *easy* foo.
