### Background
![Inside The Display](./photographs/DSC_0326.jpg)
I've been keeping a look out for cheap commercial-grade screens on eBay for a while. They tend to be over-built and extremely robust, making them suitable for a few projects; but the toughened glass and borderless frame makes them particularly suited to applications where they may have things rested on them, or they're likely to be used by others without great care.

I've want to make an interactive coffee table and gaming unit for some time. This Acrelec is a big 32" 1080p capacitive multi-touch unit, with an integrated PSU and robust mounting options. It cost me around 100 GBP, and likely came from a fast-food restaurant or public information kiosk. It's ideal for this project.


### Design


### Computer Installation
![Checking The Fit](./photographs/DSC_0326.jpg)
I'd be using some existing hardware for this build; a very compact ITX case, an ITX motherboard, I5 CPU and the absolutely brilliant Noctua NH-L9i cooler. The case is sufficiently small that it requires a DC-DC PSU with an external AC-DC switched mode supply; but that's perfect in the limited space of the display's rear compartment.

![Anchoring The Case](./photographs/DSC_0510.jpg)
An interesting feature of this particular ITX case is that the top and bottom panels have a slide-locking mechanism rather than screws. This made it very easy to secure the case to the display's frame; by bolting the 'bottom' panel of the case through its vent holes, I could simply position the case over the panel and slide it across to secure it. Care was taken to ensure the case is on the DC low-voltage side of the display's PSU and isolated from any AC components.

![Fitted With Cover Installed](./photographs/DSC_0492.jpg)
Despite its diminutive size, the case is still too tall to fit under the rear cover, so I had to cut a section out to accommodate it. This actually worked out nicely, as the display cover locks the case's sliding mechanism, so the computer cannot be knocked out of the frame unless the display cover is removed entirely.

The protruding case is not visible from above the table. it would have been nice to fit the computer entirely within the original display case; which would have been easily possible with an Android box or slim Atom-based SFF machine; but I wouldn't have been able to achieve the same performance or flexibility as this configuration offers.

### Oak Surround
![Creating The Top](./photographs/DSC_0365.jpg)
A lot of the furniture in my house is solid oak; though almost none of it was bought from a store; solid wooden furniture is typically very expensive and often not high enough quality to justify the cost.

I've found that I can order unfinished solid Oak tops for relatively little money (90-180 GBP) and simply attach my own legs to make a table or bench. Likewise relatively cheap (~60 GBP) wire-mesh shelving can be combined with the same oak tops to make very pleasing yet affordable storage.

![Creating The Top](./photographs/DSC_0375.jpg)
Rather than just have a bare glass screen, I decided to surround the display with an Oak frame to match the TV stand and shelving in the room. This would also provide an area to place glasses and mugs without interfering with the touch display.

However rather than buying a top of the correct size and cutting a hole for the display, I purchased two long planks of Oak and cut them down, then sandwiched them together to create a staved effect. The interior hole ws then routed smooth to match the screen outline as closely as possible, while still allowing a little space for expansion and contraction.

![Staining With Danish Oil](./photographs/DSC_0411.jpg)
I used the same finish I use on all my Oak pieces; Danish Oil. This provides protection against moisture and enhances the natural grain of the wood.

In hindsight I made the fit against the screen too close; after a few months of use the wood contracted slightly and became too tight against the display to remove easily. For fear of the pressure damaging the display and after a great deal of effort to free it, I re-routed the hole slightly larger to accommodate this movement.

### Steel Legs
![Correcting & Prepping](./photographs/DSC_0440.jpg)
I've previously designed and ordered custom powered-coated steel table and bench legs from a local manufacturer. They actually cost relatively little (typically 60-90 GBP per pair) and look fantastic. I wanted to match the size and style of those I'd already had made, but the usual manufacturer wasn't available, so I tried another.

Unfortunately they did a rather poor job and I had to grind-down and re-finish the supplied legs to meet the same standard as those I'd had made previously.

![Re-Finishing The Legs](./photographs/DSC_0447.jpg)
On the plus side, my disappointment with the ordered parts and the process of re-finishing them made it clear I could get a really good and durable finish just with some primer and a rattle-can. Not long after this project was completed, I decided to have a go myself and acquired a low-cost flux-core welder and steel stock. I fabricated _my own_ steel legs (in the same style) for another project, [with great results](#).

![Threaded Mounting Holes](./photographs/DSC_0453.jpg)
After finishing the legs I started assembling the table. The legs themselves have two unthreaded holes through which large bolts are inserted into the back of the display. These go into the steel display frame and provide a robust structure. The leg tops extend beyond the edge of the display, exposing the previously threaded holes, which extend down into the hollow steel uprights.

![Adjustable Rubber Mounts](./photographs/DSC_0501.jpg)
Since wood needs to expand and contract, the Oak surround is a free-standing element; no bolts or screws attach it to the frame or legs. Instead, I screw threaded rubber bumpers (as used in machinery as soft end-stops) into the threaded holes on the leg tops to act as supports for the wood. These can be raised or lowered to fine-tune its height and level relative to the display. They also provide a nice soft cushion to absorb any impacts on the table top.

The wooden top is sufficiently heavy (and the bumpers are close enough to the corners) that there is no danger of the top levering up if pushed down on one side or corner. However if needed the top can be lifted straight off the top of the table; e.g. for maintenance or repair.

The end result is fantastic and I'm pleased things went more or less as planned. Playing touch-screen games on this is a joy. The system dual-boots Windows 10 and Android 9 for greater library of titles. I intend to write a few basic HTML/JS multiplayer games (Pong, Breakout, etc) to enjoy with friends and family.

I've since under-slung a Q Acoustics Q-TV2 speaker box (designed to mount behind TVs) to provide impactful sound directly from the table instead than relying on an external wireless speaker system.

One of the unexpected uses for this table is general web-browsing and content consumption (particularly while YouTube plays on the main HTPC/TV). This works particularly well when collaboratively looking for things with friends and family; e.g. shopping, researching topics, etc
