## S2000 Bluetooth Head Unit
![Installed Dock](./photographs/DSC_0187.jpg)
A smartphone-based wireless charging dock and head unit replacement for the S2000; but adaptable to any pretty much any vehicle. It converts button presses from the factory audio controls (a resistor network) into bluetooth playback commands on the host device:

‘MODE’ triggers a media ‘play/pause’ command
‘CH’ triggers a media ‘next track’ command
‘VOL +’ and ‘VOL -’ send system volume commands
‘MUTE’ activates the amplifier’s ‘mute’ facility directly

All based on an Arduino micro-controller and fully configurable.
